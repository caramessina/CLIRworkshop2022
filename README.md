# CLIR Fellows Workshop 2022
This GitHub repository was created for the 2022 CLIR Fellows workshop introducing GitHub, GitHub Desktop, and GitHub Pages. This repository is temporary and only meant to be used by the fellows for practice. 

## Folder Structure
Each workshop participant will create their own folder following a naming convention: INITIALS+favoriteyear. Inside each folder will be a markdown file that contains information about:
- A header introducing the file
- Participant's favorite color
- How the participant may use GitHub
